            <h2>Xbox One UI</h2>
        
            <p>One user interface that I probably interact with more than I should is that of the Xbox One. While it's not my favorite UI to navigate through, it has definitely gotten much better with its last update a few months ago. Since it's owned by Microsoft the dashboard is a tile-based system based off of the ones used in Windows 8 and the new Windows 10. For users that play online, the new interface makes it much easier to chat with friends, see who's online, and view notifications by making all of those items just one button-press away.</p>
            
            <p>When looking at the main content of the dashboard, one can find their current game or application in the biggest tile so that it's easy to get back to it as quick as possible. Below that comes the other most-used apps on your device - giving it a decent heirachy to navigate around. The rightmost column on the screen is used for advertisements/announcements of new games that are available in the online store. Overall, I think the Xbox One UI could still use some improvements, but it is definitely making progress when comparing it to their previous version.</p>
