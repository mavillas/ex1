            <h2>Airbnb Forms</h2>
        
            <p>At a glance, Airbnb's design looks very clean and easy to navigate, but it's when you dive in deeper that you start to realize how good it actually is. Specifically looking at the forms - which could be the most crucial part of their interface - you really start to see their great user experiene in action. Airbnb's forms are the backbone of their platform and they definitely made sure to highlight that in their design and overall usability. In Bill DeRouchey's slideshow about interface design he hits on several points that Airbnb does very well.</p>
            
            <p>I think that one of the more important things that DeRouchey mentions is hierarchy; which is really important when it comes to forms. Since Airbnb provides people with a way to search for places to stay all around the world, it's really important to get the hierachy of search forms correct. They went about this by making the hierachy: Location -> Dates -> Number of guests -> Room type -> Price range. I feel that this order is one of the best they could've come up with. Another thing he brings up is whether or not the interface communicates clearly. I think a great example of how Airbnb's forms do this is their use of calendars in the "Dates" forms. Instead of typing in a date and potentially mistaking the day of the week you wanted to go, it shows you a calendar to provide visual clarity.</p>

            <h2>Xbox One UI</h2>
        
            <p>One user interface that I probably interact with more than I should is that of the Xbox One. While it's not my favorite UI to navigate through, it has definitely gotten much better with its last update a few months ago. Since it's owned by Microsoft the dashboard is a tile-based system based off of the ones used in Windows 8 and the new Windows 10. For users that play online, the new interface makes it much easier to chat with friends, see who's online, and view notifications by making all of those items just one button-press away.</p>
            
            <p>When looking at the main content of the dashboard, one can find their current game or application in the biggest tile so that it's easy to get back to it as quick as possible. Below that comes the other most-used apps on your device - giving it a decent heirachy to navigate around. The rightmost column on the screen is used for advertisements/announcements of new games that are available in the online store. Overall, I think the Xbox One UI could still use some improvements, but it is definitely making progress when comparing it to their previous version.</p>
